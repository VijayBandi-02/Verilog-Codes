## ðŸŸ  Half Adder â€“ Verilog 
## ðŸ“Œ Introduction:
A **Half Adder** is a basic combinational circuit that performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers.
It has **two inputs (A, B)** and **two outputs (Sum, Carry).**

## âš¡ Logic Equations
* **Sum (S) = A âŠ• B**
* **Carry (C) = A â‹… B**

## ðŸ“Š Truth Table
* | a = 0, b = 0 -> sum = 0, carry = 0 |
* | a = 0, b = 1 -> sum = 1, carry = 0 |
* | a = 1, b = 0 -> sum = 1, carry = 0 |
* | a = 1, b = 1 -> sum = 0, carry = 1 |
