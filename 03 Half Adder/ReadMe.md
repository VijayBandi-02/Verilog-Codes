ðŸŸ  Half Adder â€“ Verilog
ðŸ“Œ Introduction:
A Half Adder is a basic combinational circuit that performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers.
It has two inputs (A, B) and two outputs (Sum, Carry).

âš¡ Logic Equations
Sum (S) = A âŠ• B
Carry (C) = A â‹… B

-----------------------
| A	| B |	Sum	| Carry |
-----------------------
| 0	| 0	|  0	|   0   |
| 0	| 1	|  1  |  	0   |
| 1	| 0	|  1	|   0   |
| 1 |	1 |	 0	|   1   |
